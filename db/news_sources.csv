Apple has also announced some upcoming changes to the way AirTags work in order to address privacy concerns, while it looks like Apple's long-rumored AR/VR headset is coming closer to fruition, so read on for details on these stories and more! Apple Announces 'Tap to Pay' Feature Allowing iPhones to Easily Accept Contactless Payments Apple this week announced a new ""Tap to Pay on iPhone"" feature that will allow the iPhone XS and newer to accept contactless payments from other iPhones or credit cards without any additional hardware required. Apple said the feature will launch in the U.S. later this year within supported iOS apps. Tap to Pay on iPhone will likely roll out with iOS 15.4 based on code-level references to the feature uncovered by MacRumors in the latest beta release. Everything New in iOS 15.4 Beta 2: Face ID Updates, Tap to Pay Code and More Apple this week seeded the second betas of iOS 15.4, iPadOS 15.4, macOS 12.3, watchOS 8.5, and tvOS 15.4 to developers and public beta testers. The second beta of iOS 15.4 includes some new features and changes, including references to Apple's upcoming Tap to Pay on iPhone feature, preparations for state IDs and driver's licenses in the Wallet app, tweaked wording for the Face ID With a Mask feature, and more. Apple also released iOS 15.3.1, macOS 12.2.1, and watchOS 8.4.2 with bug fixes. Apple Announces AirTag Updates to Address Unwanted Tracking Apple this week announced that it is making some updates to AirTags with the aim of cutting down on unwanted tracking.

Check out our video overview of the latest rumors on the headset, and let us know whether you'd be willing to spend $2,000+ on it! Tesla Design Chief on Apple Products: 'There's Nothing to Look Forward To' Tesla design chief Franz von Holzhausen recently commented on Apple's design principles and product launches, lamenting that Apple doesn't deliver something ""to look forward to"" anymore. While admitting that he wears an Apple Watch for fitness tracking purposes, von Holzhausen opined that Apple's devices have become ""just a continuation"" and a ""slight refinement on the same thing."" Apple Hit With Class Action Lawsuit Over 'Jelly Scrolling' on iPad Mini A Colorado man this week filed a class action lawsuit against Apple that accuses the company of fraudulently marketing and selling the sixth-generation iPad mini despite being aware of a so-called ""jelly scrolling"" defect with the device. Apple last year told Ars Technica that the effect is normal behavior for LCD screens, but the lawsuit alleges that ""jelly scrolling"" is actually a defect that Apple is aware of and should either fix or acknowledge in marketing materials for the device.

In a media interview, Gadkari said he met the head of the Indian arm of Tesla ""three-four days back"". ""I have tried to convince him. Ultimately it is dependent on him to take the decision (to manufacture in the country),"" Gadkari told News 18. Stressing that Musk has to manufacture here first in order to roll out Tesla cars on the roads, the Minister said: ""Now his (Musk's) interest is to manufacture the Tesla car in China and make it sell in India. ""So, if you start here, you are welcome, no problem. But manufacturing in China and selling in India is not a digestible concept to all of us"". When asked about Tesla's demand to cut customs duties on electric cars, Gadkari said that the country cannot appease one automobile company. ""India is a huge market. We have all the world's automobile giants -- BMW, Volvo, Mercedes-Benz, Toyota, Honda, Hyundai -- present here. If we give one benefit to one company, we have to give that benefit to other companies also. That is the practical problem,"" he elaborated. Musk recently tweeted that he faced challenges from the government for releasing its products in India. ""Tesla isn't in India yet due to ""Challenges with the government"", he posted. Tesla has registered its office in Bengaluru as Tesla India Motors and Energy Private Limited and named three directors. The firm is registered with an authorised capital of Rs 15 lakh and paid-up capital of Rs 1 lakh. Earlier this week, the government questioned Tesla's business practices of seeking tax breaks to use the Indian market to sell its products, but not wanting to set up manufacturing facilities in the country which can generate thousands of jobs. ""We can't grant subsidies or relaxation in taxes to the said company as they don't want to set-up their manufacturing and other operation bases here. Why should we favour a company which create jobs in China and mints profit from our markets?"" Minister for Heavy Industries, Krishna Pal Gujjar, told the Lok Sabha in response to a question. ""Our Prime Minister has a vision for all such foreign companies, if you want to sell your product in our country, then manufacture them here only,"" Gujjar added. The minister informed the house that Tesla hasn't shown any interest in any of the government's schemes for electric vehicles. As per the Ministry of Heavy Industries, the government has formulated a scheme, Faster Adoption and Manufacturing of (Hybrid amp;) Electric Vehicles in India (FAME India) Scheme in 2015 to promote the adoption of electric/hybrid vehicles (EVs) in the country with an aim to reduce dependency on fossil fuels. --IANS","https://englishtribuneimages.blob.core.windows.net/gallary-content/2022/2/2022_2$largeimg_126797464.jpeg",""

This is understandable. The sales volume of the new iPhone 15 in China was slower than that of the iPhone 14 series, and Apple gave its largest market share to Huawei. Apple’s annual sales in China are about $74 billion (about 100 trillion won in the 2022 fiscal year). The sales account for about 20 percent of its total sales. If sales in China slow down, Apple could falter. That sense of crisis brought Cook back to China.After the Chinese government ordered civil servants not to bring iPhones to work, Apple’s stock price fluctuated. It was perceived as China pushing Apple out. A jab to check Apple could trigger a big counter punch. Could Apple be alright staying in China under such circumstances?Samsung suffered in the same way. Its Galaxy smartphones once took up more than 20 percent of the Chinese market, but now it has little presence. That started with the Note 7 fire incident in 2015. Samsung officials recall that Beijing used the incident as an excuse to persistently push out Galaxy.The real causes can be found elsewhere. At that time, Samsung Galaxy was accelerating its efforts to break away from China. As the construction of the Vietnamese factory, which began in 2008, was completed, relocation work went underway one by one. Samsung closed its Tianjin plant in 2018 and its Huizhou plant in 2019. Currently, more than half of Samsung phones are produced in Vietnam. In other words, when Samsung relocated the factories, it had to give up its market share, too.Technology is another cause. At that time, the technology level of Chinese smartphone makers such as Oppo, Vivo and Xiaomi was already advanced enough to surpass that of Samsung. China’s formula for attracting foreign capital — giving market share in return for technology transfer — didn’t work anymore. To make matters worse, the geopolitical risk from the U.S.-led Thaad anti-missile system deployment occurred in 2016, which forced Galaxy to exit China.Apple’s current situation is the déjà vu of what Samsung had gone through. Apple is seeking to diversify its factories. As Samsung did, Apple is going to Vietnam and India. Its technology does not overwhelm Chinese companies, either. The recently announced Huawei 5G phone is known to have been 90 percent localized in production, including domestic procurement of 7-nanometer chips. Moreover, a geopolitical risk even greater than the Thaad weighs on Apple.Depending on how the conflict between the U.S. and China develops, Beijing’s order to boycott Apple could spread out of the public sector. It is hard for Apple to find a solution as it has to be mindful of the Chinese government on top of its overreliance on China for its market and factories. Tim Cook’s risky “100-trillion-won tightrope walk” has begun.       애플은 중국에서 안녕한가? 한우덕 차이나랩 수석기자   애플 CEO 팀 쿡은 지난주 내내 중국에 있었다. 지난 3월 이후 7개월 만에 또 갔다. 이해가 간다. 신작 ‘아이폰15’의 중국 판매량이 전작(14시리즈)보다 부진했고, 시장점유율 1위 자리를 화웨이에 내줘야 했다. 애플의 한해 중국 판매액은 약 740억 달러(약 100조원, 2022 회계연도). 전체매출의 약 20% 수준이다. 중국판매가 주춤하면 애플 전체가 흔들릴 수 있다. 그 위기감이 쿡을 중국으로 다시 불렀다.     “공무원들은 아이폰 갖고 출근하지 마.” 중국정부의 이 조치에 애플주가는 출렁였다. 중국의 '애플 밀어내기'로 받아들여졌기 때문이다. 잽 수준의 견제에도 애플은 카운터 펀치급 충격을 받는다. “애플은 과연 중국에서 안녕할 것인가?”라는 의문이 제기되는 이유다.     삼성도 그랬다. 한때 중국시장의 20% 이상을 차지한 삼성 스마트폰 갤럭시는 지금 존재감 제로다. 시작은 2015년 터진 노트7 발화사건이었다. ""중국정부는 이 사건을 빌미로 집요하게 '갤럭시 밀어내기'에 나섰다""고 삼성관계자들은 회고한다.     진짜 원인은 다른 데 있었다. 당시 삼성 갤럭시는 탈(脫)중국에 박차를 가하고 있었다. 2008년부터 시작한 베트남 공장건설이 마무리되면서 이전 작업을 하나하나 진행 중이었다. 삼성은 2018년 톈진(天津)공장, 2019년 후이저우(惠州)공장 문을 닫았다. 현재 삼성 폰의 절반 이상이 베트남에서 생산된다. 공장을 뺄 때 시장도 모두 반납하고 나와야 했던 셈이다.     기술도 원인이다. 당시 오포·비보·샤오미 등 중국 스마트폰 기술수준은 삼성을 능가할 만큼 올라와 있었다. '시장 줄게, 기술 다오' 식의 중국 외자유치 공식은 더는 통하지 않았다. 설상가상 2016년 ‘사드’라는 지정학 위기가 터졌고, 갤럭시는 퇴출 수순을 밟아야 했다.     지금 애플의 상황은 삼성의 데자뷔다. 애플은 공장다각화를 추진 중이다. 삼성이 그랬듯, 베트남과 인도로 간다. 기술도 중국기업을 압도하지 못한다. 최근 발표된 화웨이 5G폰은 7나노 칩을 국내에서 조달하는 등 국산화율 90%를 넘긴 것으로 알려졌다. 여기에 사드보다 더 큰 지정학적 리스크가 애플을 짓누른다.     미·중갈등이 어떻게 번지느냐에 따라 중국의 애플 불매 ‘지령’이 공직사회를 벗어날 수 있다. 시장·공장 모두 중국눈치를 봐야 하는 애플로선 마땅한 카드 찾기가 쉽지 않다. 팀 쿡의 아슬아슬한 ‘100조 줄타기’가 시작됐다.","",""

Todo ello mientras muchas miradas ya se dirigen hacia el proyecto de 2024 que apunta a estrenarse en Nintendo Switch 2, aunque aún falta para conocer los primeros detalles de esta nueva dimensión en la saga. Por el momento, Game Freak se centra en el citado DLC, que habría perdido uno de sus Pokémon más poderosos por un error técnico.Así lo ha revelado el filtrador por excelencia en todo lo relativo a Pokémon, que no es otro que Riddler Khu, quien lleva ya algunos años ofreciendo información fidedigna sobre diferentes títulos de la franquicia. Tal y como revela, uno de los Pokémon más poderosos que se estaban preparando para su aterrizada en Pokémon Escarlata y Púrpura mediante El Disco Índigo se ha perdido por completo debido a un error, por lo que nunca llegaremos a verlo en el resultado final de este contenido. Se desconoce a qué criatura hace referencia, pero sí apunta a que iba a tener un estado teracristalizado, una de las grandes novedades de este segundo DLC.Did you know?

[EPA/YONHAP]   Tottenham Hotspur climbed straight back to the top of the Premier League table on Monday, beating Fulham 2-0 to remain undefeated nine games into the 2023-24 season.   The win was par the course for Ange Postecoglou’s transformed Tottenham squad, overwhelming Fulham not with dramatically more possession or power but with a creativity and energy that has proven unstoppable so far this campaign.   Related ArticleSon Heung-min named September Player of the Month[VIDEO] James Maddison on his double-assist and the connection with Son Heung-minSon Heung-min brace saves Spurs in fiery North London Derby draw   Captain Son Heung-min was again at the center of the action, scoring the opener in the 36th minute and then assisting James Maddison for goal No. 2 in the 54th.   Both goals came from Fulham giving away the ball in a bad spot — Richarlison picked up the loose ball for the first goal, picking out Son who volleyed it into the top corner, with Son then doing almost the exact same thing for Maddison in the second half.   Tottenham's Son Heung-min, right, scores his side's opening goal during a Premier League match against Fulham at Tottenham Hotspur Stadium in London on Monday. [AP/YONHAP]   Spurs had plenty of other opportunities — if there’s anything to complain about, it’s that the score was not higher — but were unable to convert. Fulham also created some chances, but Spurs stuck with the plan and shut down anything before it became too threatening.   It wasn’t all perfect. While Maddison and Son were calm and collected and even Richarlison seemed more comfortable with his role in the squad than he has for months, Dejan Kulusevski looked a little timid and Pierre Hojbjerg’s timing was off, resulting in an early yellow card.   Postecoglou was characteristically blunt about how he thought the team performed, criticizing the second half in his post-match interview.   “I thought we were really wasteful with the ball in the second half,” he said. “We took some liberties with taking extra touches. I’ve been around long enough to know if you try to take liberties, you’ll get dragged down pretty quickly.   “I’m not going to let the fact that we’ve won the game disguise the opportunity there for us to improve.”   Despite the team’s success this season — Arsenal are the only other undefeated team and they have one less win than Spurs — Postecoglou reiterated that he still thinks there is a long way to go.   “What I’m saying is that we have to improve,” he said. “That responsibility is on me to make sure we do. We can be better, absolutely we can. Within that context, without the ball I thought we were brilliant tonight. We were outstanding. Let’s not discount it.   “It takes a hell of a lot of effort and commitment from the boys to that side of the game. That was there the whole time. That side of the game got us the victory tonight. But we need to be better when we have the ball as well.”   Monday’s goal was Son’s 50th at Tottenham Hotspur Stadium — where he was also the first player ever to score on the ground’s opening day back on April 3, 2019 — a milestone only beaten by former Spurs star Harry Kane. Among current Premier League players, only Mohammad Salah of Liverpool has scored more goals on a single pitch, with 65 at Anfield.   Son now has seven goals and one assist this season, tying with Salah for second in the Premier League goal standings behind Erling Haaland of Manchester City with nine. This isn’t the first time Son and Salah have tied on goals — the pair split the 2021-22 Golden Boot.   Son isn’t the only Korean footballer near the top of the table. Wolverhampton Wanderers’ Hwang Hee-chan is currently tied for sixth with five goals to his name.   Spurs have little time to rest this as they’ll be back in action in the Premier League on Friday as they take on Crystal Palace on the road in south London. That game will be followed by a match against Chelsea on Nov. 6 before the highly-anticipated Korean derby against Wolves on Nov. 11.

The US. Coast Guard has since recovered remaining debris of the Titan as well as presumed human remains. The remains will be analyzed by U.S. medical professionals. In the comments, many agreed with Lenore that it’s too soon to be poking fun at the tragedy.  “I assumed people would use the oceangate sub this Halloween but still feels a bit too soon,"" one user wrote. But many found the decoration funny, and cracked jokes at the submarine expense. “Lol crushed it,” one wrote, joking about the submersible imploding. “Wasn’t the sub made from the same materials?” added another.  “Just missing the same controller,” a third wrote, in reference to the Logitech gaming controller that Rush used to operate the Titan.  CBS reporter David Pogue raised safety concerns about the controller when he took a tour of the Titan. In a video, he said he “couldn’t help noticing how many pieces of this sub seemed improvised, with off-the-shelf components.” This isn’t the first time people have made jokes about the Titan’s fate. When the submersible went missing, social media was flooded with tweets, TikToks, and memes poking fun at the absurdity of the expedition. Many justified these jokes at the passengers' expense by saying that being reckless with their extravagant wealth got them into the situation. However, many others fired back against these “eat the rich” sentiments. “The entire online discussion surrounding the OceanGate submarine is an indictment on the vile nature of social media,” wrote Twitter user @chrisLXXXVI. “Five people are either dead or starving of oxygen (imagine the terror) and Twitter is awash with jokes/hot takes about them. Gross.” The Daily Dot reached out to Lenore via TikTok comment. Sign up to receive the Daily Dot’s Internet Insider newsletter for urgent news from the frontline of online.
